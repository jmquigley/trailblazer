/**
 * Implementation of the Recursive Backtracking maze algorithm from the book
 * "Mazes for Programmers".  Similar to the Hunt and Kill algorithm.  The
 * algorithm selects unvisited neighbors from the current location.  If it
 * is not empty, then one of the unvisited neighbors are randomly selected.
 * That selected neighbor is linked to the current value and the neighbor
 * is pushed on the stack.  If there are no neighbors, then an item is
 * removed from the stack and the process continues until th stack is
 * empty.
 *
 * #### Examples:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import {AlgorithmType, Maze} from 'trailz';
 *
 * const maze = new Maze(10, 10, AlgorithmType.RecursiveBacktracker);
 * console.log(maze.string);
 * ```
 *
 * @module RecursiveBacktracker
