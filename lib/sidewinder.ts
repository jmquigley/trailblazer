/**
 * Implementation of the Sidewinder maze algorithm from the book
 * "Mazes for Programmers".  In this algorithm we iterate through
 * the rows.  With each row we then iterate through each column.
 * As each column is encountered we decide if we can continue to
 * move east (or a random chance to stop).  If we can continue, push
 * that cell into a list of "runs".  When the stop condition occurs
 * we choose a random value from the list of runs and link it
 * to its northern neighbor.  Continue this process until all rows
 * and their respective columns are encountered.
 *
 * #### Examples:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import {AlgorithmType, Maze} from 'trailz';
 *
 * const maze = new Maze(10, 10, AlgorithmType.Sidewinder);
 * console.log(maze.string);
 * ```
 *
 * @module Sidewinder
