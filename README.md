This library is based on the algorithms from the book [Mazes for Programmers: Code Your Own Twisty Little Passages](https://www.amazon.com/Mazes-Programmers-Twisty-Little-Passages/dp/1680500554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503783819&sr=8-1&keywords=Mazes+for+programmers), by Jamis Buck


## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v7.5+
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) v0.28.4


## Installation

This module uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage dependencies and run scripts for development.

To install as an application dependency:
```
$ yarn add trailz
```

To install as a global dependency for CLI use (options below):
```
$ yarn global add trailz
```

To build the app and run all tests:
```
$ yarn run all
```


## Overview

To use the library create an instance of the `Maze` class with the size requirements and algorithm type.  It will automatically generate the maze and save it within a grid.  The contents of the maze can be retrieved by using the `.string` or `.repr` properties to get the contents.  The `.string` will give an ASCII string representation of the maze.  The `.repr` method will return a two dimensional array that contains the representation of that cell.  This representation is 1 of 16 possible representations for a cell (for drawing purposes).

### Usage

```javascript
import {AlgorithmType, Maze} from 'trailz';

const maze = new Maze(10, 10, AlgorithmType.BinaryTree);
console.log(maze.string);
```

This will create a new instance of a maze using the BinaryTree algorithm.  A new instance of the maze can be rebuilt without creating a new instance with:

```javascript
maze.rebuild(Algorithm.BinaryTree);
```

This will reset the grid and reapply the BinaryTree algorithm to the grid.  The grid can be resized and rebuilt too.

```javascript
maze.resize(5, 5)
```

This will resize the grid to a 5x5 maze and reapply the algorithm.

### CLI

The command line interface allows one to create mazes and print their contents to a text file.

```
$ trailz -r 25 -c 25 -a Sidewinder --verbose -o maze.txt
```

This will create a 25x25 maze using the [Sidewinder](docs/lib/sidewinder.md) algorithm.  The contents will be printed to the terminal and also written to a file named `maze.txt` (the default).

```
$ trailz
```

##### Arguments

- `-r|--rows {#}` - the number of rows to create in the maze.  The default is 10.
- `-c|--cols {#}` - the number of columns to create in the maze.  The default is 10.
- `-a|--algorithm {name}` - the string name of the algorithm to use when generating the maze (see the list below).  The current default is the `BinaryTree` algorithm.
- `-v|--verbose` - will dump the contents of the generated maze to stdout.  Not shown by default.
- `-o|--output {filename}` - where to dump the contents of the maze (text file).  The file `maze.txt` is used by default and will be overwritten on successive runs.
